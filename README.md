# Python Compiler using Flex and Bison

## Description
This project is a Python compiler developed using Flex and Bison, showcasing how to implement a simple programming language compiler. The compiler translates Python-like syntax into intermediate code, providing insights into compiler design principles and techniques.

## Key Features
- **Lexical Analysis**: Utilizes Flex for lexical analysis to tokenize the input Python-like code, identifying keywords, identifiers, literals, and symbols.

- **Syntax Analysis**: Implements Bison for parsing the token stream and building a parse tree, checking the syntactical correctness of the code.

- **Intermediate Code Generation**: Translates the validated code into intermediate representation, laying the groundwork for further optimizations and execution.

- **Error Handling**: Provides comprehensive error handling for syntax and lexical errors, enhancing the robustness of the compiler.

- **Modular Design**: The project is structured to separate different compiler components, making it easy to extend and maintain.
